      "full": "The poludnitsa appears as either a beautiful young woman in white or a haggard old crone, both forms equally dangerous. She approaches field workers around noon, engaging them in complex questions or forcing them to dance until they collapse from heat exhaustion. Those who fail to answer her riddles correctly or who dare to work during midday may be struck with madness, severe illness, or death. This entity represents an ancient cultural memory encoded in folklore: the very real danger of heatstroke during agricultural work in hot climates. The poludnitsa served as a supernatural enforcer of practical health wisdom—take shelter during the hottest hours."
